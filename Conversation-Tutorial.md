# Getting started tutorial

In this short tutorial, we introduce the Conversation tool and go through the process of creating your first conversation.

## Before you begin

You'll need a service instance to start.

You created your service instance. Click **Manage**, then **Launch Tool**. Go to Step 2.

If you created a project with the Conversation service, you're all set with these prerequisites. Go to Step 1.

1.  Go to the Watson Developer Console [![Services](readme_images/launch-glyph.svg)](https://console.bluemix.net/developer/watson/services){: new_window} page.
1.  Select Conversation, click **Add Services**, and either sign up for a free {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account or log in.
1.  Type `conversation-tutorial` as the project name and click **Create Project**.

<!-- Remove this text after dedicated instances have the developer console: begin -->

If you use {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}}, create your service instance from the [Conversation ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/conversation/){: new_window} page in the Catalog.

<!-- Remove this text after dedicated instances have the developer console: end -->

## Step 1: Launch the tool
{: #launch-tool}

After you create a project that includes the Conversation service, you'll land on the project details page. Launch the  Conversation tool from here.

Click **Launch Tool** for Conversation under **Services**.

<!-- To do: Add screenshot for developer console -->

If you're prompted to log into the tool, provide your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} credentials.

If you're not at a project details page for the Conversation service, go to the Watson Developer Console [Projects ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.bluemix.net/developer/watson/projects) page and select the project.

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}}: Select your service instance from the Dashboard to launch the tooling.

## Step 2: Create a workspace
{: #create-workspace}

Your first step in the Conversation tool is to create a workspace.

A [*workspace*](configure-workspace.html) is a container for the artifacts that define the conversation flow.

1.  In the Conversation tool, click **Create**.
1.  Give your workspace the name `Conversation tutorial`. If the dialog you plan to build will use a language other than English, then choose the appropriate language from the list. Click **Create**. You ºll land on the **Intents** tab of your new workspace.

## Step 3: Create intents
{: #create-intents}

An [intent](intents.html) represents the purpose of a user's input. You can think of intents as the actions your users might want to perform with your application.

For this example, we're going to keep things simple and define only two intents: one for saying hello, and one for saying goodbye.

1.  Make sure you're on the Intents tab. (You should already be there, if you just created the workspace.)
1.  Click **Add intent**.
1.  Name the intent `hello`, and then click **Create intent**.
1.  Type `hello` into the **Add user example** field, and then press **Enter**.

   *Examples* tell the Conversation service what kinds of user input you want to match to the intent. The more examples you provide, the more accurate the service can be at recognizing user intents.
1.  Add four more examples:
    - `good morning`
    - `greetings`
    - `hi`
    - `howdy`

1.  Click the **Close** ![Close arrow](images/close_arrow.png) icon to finish creating the #hello intent.
1.  Create another intent named #goodbye with these five examples:
    - `bye`
    - `farewell`
    - `goodbye`
    - `I'm done`
    - `see you later`

You've created two intents, #hello and #goodbye, and provided example user input to train Watson to recognize these intents in your users' input.

![Shows Intents page listing the #goodbye and #hello intents](images/gs-add-intents-result.png)

## Step 4: Build a dialog
{: #build-dialog}

A [dialog](dialog-build.html) defines the flow of your conversation in the form of a logic tree. Each node of the tree has a condition that triggers it, based on user input.

We'll create a simple dialog that handles our #hello and #goodbye intents, each with a single node.

### Adding a start node

1.  In the Conversation tool, click the **Dialog** tab.
1.  Click **Create**. You'll see two nodes:
    - **Welcome**: Contains a greeting that is displayed to your users when they first engage with the bot.
    - **Anything else**: Contains phrases that are used to reply to users when their input is not recognized.

    ![Shows the dialog tree with the Welcome and Anything else nodes](images/gs-add-dialog-node-animated-cover.png)
1.  Click the **Welcome** node to open it in the edit view.
1.  Replace the default response with the text, `Welcome to the Conversation tutorial!`.

    ![Shows the Welcome node open in edit view](images/gs-edit-welcome-node.png)
1.  Click ![Close](images/close.png) to close the edit view.

You created a dialog node that is triggered by the `welcome` condition, which is a special condition that indicates that the user has started a new conversation. Your node specifies that when a new conversation starts, the system should respond with the welcome message.

### Testing the start node

You can test your dialog at any time to verify the dialog. Let's test it now.

- Click the ![Ask Watson](images/ask_watson.png) icon to open the *Try it out* pane. You should see your welcome message.

    ![Testing the dialog node](images/gs-tryitout-welcome-node.png)

### Adding nodes to handle intents

Now let's add nodes to handle our intents between the `Welcome` node and the `Anything else` node.

1.  Click the More icon ![More options](images/kabob.png) on the **Welcome** node, and then select **Add node below**.
1.  Type `#hello` in the **Enter a condition** field of this node. Then select the **#hello** option.
1.  Add the response, `Good day to you.`
1.  Click ![Close](images/close.png) to close the edit view.

   ![Shows an animation of a user adding a hello node to the dialog.](images/gs-add-dialog-node-animated.gif)
1.  Click the More icon ![More options](images/kabob.png) on this node, and then select **Add node below** to create a peer node. In the peer node, specify `#goodbye` as the condition, and `OK. See you later!` as the response.

    ![Adding nodes for intents](images/gs-add-dialog-nodes-result.png)

### Testing intent recognition

You  built a simple dialog to recognize and respond to both hello and goodbye inputs. Let's see how well it works.

1.  Click the ![Ask Watson](images/ask_watson.png) icon to open the *Try it out* pane. There's that reassuring welcome message.
1.  At the bottom of the pane, type `Hello` and press Enter. The output indicates that the #hello intent was recognized, and the appropriate response (`Good day to you.`) appears.
1.  Try the following input:
    - `bye`
    - `howdy`
    - `see ya`
    - `good morning`
    - `sayonara`

   ![Shows an animation of the user testing the dialog in the Try it out pane.](images/gs-test-dialog-animated.gif)

Watson can recognize your intents even when your input doesn't exactly match the examples you included. The dialog uses intents to identify the purpose of the user's input regardless of the precise wording used, and then responds in the way you specify.

### Result of building a dialog

That's it. You created a simple conversation with two intents and a dialog to recognize them.

## Step 5: Review the sample workspace
{: #review-sample-workspace}

Open the sample workspace to see intents similar to the ones you just created plus many more, and see how they are used in a complex dialog.

1.  Go back to the Workspaces page.
   You can click the ![Back to workspaces button](images/workspaces-button.png) button from the navigation menu.
1.  On the **Car Dashboard - Sample** workspace tile, click the **Edit sample** button.

    ![Shows the car dashboard sample tile on the Workspaces page](images/gs-workspace-car-sample.png)

## Next steps
{: #next-steps}

This tutorial is built around a simple example. For a real application, you'll need to define some more interesting intents, some entities, and a more complex dialog.

- Try the advanced [tutorial](tutorial.html) to add entities and clarify a user's purpose.
- [Deploy](deploy.html) your workspace by connecting it to a front-end user interface, social media, or a messaging channel.
- Check out the [sample apps](sample-applications.html).
